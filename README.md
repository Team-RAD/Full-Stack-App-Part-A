### R1 - Description of website

#### Purpose

_Problem:_ Technology is a massive industry with many pathways of entry and career directions to take. It’s often very daunting for new tech hopefuls to get started on their journey and this can be made harder by uncertainty with how best to proceed due to seemingly limitless opinions online.

Consider Jane: She is a career changer who is moving from retail to technology… but she has a great deal of “options paralysis” due to the sheer amount of information online about how she should make this happen. Any Google search yields thousands of opinions and resources and this can make even the most determined person confused and even discouraged.

_Solution:_ Naruto Run helps to speed up the process of identifying which area of the tech world people want to work in and the best road to run down to get there. It does this by providing a hub for the posting of tech career journeys by users already in the industry (contributors) for the reference of other users (seekers) wanting to make the move into tech. It allows contributors to outline their path into a tech career in a condensed, efficient form, so that seekers can quickly distill this information and that of other NR posts into a clearer picture of where they should focus their efforts.
